# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## This Journey Actually Started on 1st of January 2018, i started keeping a log on March 21, 2018,

### Day 73: March 21, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Worked on CSS flexbox, Udacity Nanodegree Scholarship - Pixel Art Maker build this time with pure VanillaJS.

**Thoughts:** Mixing jQuery methods/functions with vanillaJs time to time, need to rewind a little bit and read docs again.
